# Array and ArrayList

###### 064 - URL

This Java project demonstrates three key functionalities for working with arrays and ArrayLists:

## Features

### 1. Odd/Even Separation
- The program accepts numbers from the user and separates them into two arrays: even and odd.
- It uses an `ArrayList` to store and display the results.

### 2. Minimum Consecutive Difference
- Finds two neighboring numbers in an array with the smallest distance (difference) between them.
- Returns the index of the first number and displays the minimum difference.

### 3. Array and ArrayList Conversion
- Converts an array into an `ArrayList` and vice versa.
- Demonstrates both conversions and displays the results.

## How to Use

1. **Compile and Run**
   - Compile the `Main.java` file and execute it.
   
2. **Provide Input**
   - Enter the size of the array.
   - Input the numbers when prompted.
   
3. **View Results**
   - See the output for:
     - Odd/Even separation
     - Minimum difference calculation
     - Array to `ArrayList` conversion and vice versa

## Code Structure

- **`ArrayFunctions.java`**: Contains methods for odd/even separation, minimum difference calculation, and array conversions.
- **`ArrayInput.java`**: Handles user input for creating an array.
- **`Main.java`**: The entry point of the program, where all functionalities are demonstrated.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Any Java-supported IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

## Example
```java
Enter the size of the array: 5
Enter the numbers: 3 8 2 7 5

Odd Numbers: [3, 7, 5]
Even Numbers: [8, 2]
Minimum difference: 1 at index: 2
ArrayList after conversion: [3, 8, 2, 7, 5]
Back to array: [3, 8, 2, 7, 5]
```
